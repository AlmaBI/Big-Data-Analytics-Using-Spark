For Audit Learners
Download the tar file for the notebooks: Section2-Weather-PCA_PART1 and Section2-Weather-PCA_PART2

After Downloading the files  unpack it using the commands:

tar -xzf Section2NotebooksPart1.tgz

tar -xzf Section2NotebooksPart2.tgz

You should get directories named Section2-Weather-PCA_PART1 and  Section2-Weather-PCA_PART2 which contains all of the notebooks used in weeks 3 and 4. Feel free to merge the two parts (just copy all the notebooks from PART2 to PART1) for your own convenience.
