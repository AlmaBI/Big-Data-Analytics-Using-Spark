# Big-Data-Analytics-Using-Spark

## Learning objectives ##
This course has two main goals: The first is introduction to using large scale data analysis frameworks (Spark, XGBoost and TensorFlow). This includes the underlying computer architecture and the programming abstractions. The second is to combine methods from statistics and machine learning to perform large scale analysis, identify statistically significant pattern and visualize statistical summaries.
 
## Topics ##
* Memory Hierarchy, latency vs. throughput.
* Spark Basics
* Dataframes and SQL
* PCA and weather analysis
* K-means and intrinsic dimensions
* Decision trees, boosting, and random forests
* Neural Networks and TensorFlow
